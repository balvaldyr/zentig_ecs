TODO:

figure out why its a stack overflow when you have too many components registered
only heap allocate the things that need to be heap allocated.

change system ordering to allow more defined ordering, such as:

ztg.ordered(myUpdate).after(.gtr_update).label(.check_collisions)

also find a way to make labels more unique?
i can see someone using a very generic label in a library and fucking things up

idk if its possible but maybe:

const MyLabels = enum {
    gtr_update,
    check_collisions,
};

ztg.ordered(myUpdate).after(MyLabels.gtr_update)

maybe @typeName(T) ++ @tagName(v)?
and if it's not an enum (zero sized struct) use the type name?

NICE TO HAVE:

Level Management:
Store component by type name and have lookup table in file?
Comptime string hashmap to convert names into compontent_utps

Change ComponentArray to use the enum NULL syntax

???:

Crashes when using any allocator other than gpa
